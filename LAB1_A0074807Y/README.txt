Hi!

My 
NAME : Madhu
Matric number : A0074807Y
index.html : HotelRenaissance.html

I have made the homepage of a hotel's website.
The homepage contains a vertically stacked navbar, a carousel, a form to book rooms( as all hotel websites have this feature on their homepage ),etc.

1. The html will function as intended only when there is internet connectivity as I've linked jquery js files online.  So please use the internet. :)
2. Have used the grid system extensively.
3. Responsive design is done.
4. Base CSS: I ve used all of the base css components available in bootstrap except tables.
5. Components: Have used drpdowns, button, navbars, wells etc.
6. Javascript category item : I have the carousel predominantly.
7. jQuery effects : Pressing the words "Luxury Suite" repeatedly will show some effects. ;)
8. Form validation : Press the "Book Now!" button to see the effects of form validation.
9. Others : Have used the jQuery datepicker( for which you need the internet) to help user input arrival and departure dates.

Thats it. Hope you like the homepage!
